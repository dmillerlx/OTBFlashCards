## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### **Before:**
```
Variation 5 of 45 | Position: Move 12 of 24 ⭐ PRIORITY
[Popup]: "This variation has been marked as PRIORITY"
```
Annoying popup interrupts flow! ❌

### **After:**
```
Variation 5 of 45 | Position: Move 12 of 24
⭐ PRIORITY
   ^^^^^^^^ Bold orange, super visible!
```
No popup, instant visual feedback! ✅
